Climate Change will trigger change in other variables as in the rainfall. The IPCC developed shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) and representative concentration pathway (RCP) that assess the evolution of multiple variables in different possible scenarios. These scenarios can be translated into rainfall predictions, and all the scenarios predict an increase in rainfalls. This increase can lead in certain regions to a significant increase in flooding risk. This paper develops a probability flood map for floods resulting from climate change in the future in France using three scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) and compares two models for this task: a Neural Network and a Gradient Boosting model. 500 past flood events and 500 other locations were used as dependent variables. 12 factors were used as independent variables, including rainfall information. Of the 1000 events, 800 were used as a train set, and 200 as a validation set. Both models show that the main factors affecting the flood probability are the altitude, distance to a river and rainfall. The flood probability map generated by the Gradient Boosting model shows that the southern east part of the country will have a flood probability of 30% in scenario RCP2.6, 35% in scenario RCP4.5 and of 40% in scenario RCP8.5, thus being the most at-risk region in France.
